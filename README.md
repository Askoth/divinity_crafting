> Divinity Original Sin Crafting list os all material possibilities to craft what you want

Thanks [sethxd](https://github.com/sethxd) for [divinity_crafting](https://github.com/sethxd/divinity_crafting)

Maybe it was just me but when I started to go over the crafting list on thing needs another crafted and so on.... In the end I was lost with so many materials I would have to keep in mind.

I find this also a fun exercise to learn nuxtjs. Let's see how it goes.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).
